## My process
I started with the basics and laid everything down using html markup and used CSS to design what you see before you, I decided to use this font which i really liked here is the link to it (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter)
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
I learnt the concept of accessibility and was able to apply it in my website for the first tine, it may not really be that good yet but considering i just picked this up for the first time, I still feel really good about it. Shout out to front-end mentor for showing that i had accessibility issues. In addition of implimenting proper hierarchies in my header tags.
```html
 <body>
    <div role="banner">This is the header</div>
    <div role="navigation">This is the nav</div>
    <div role="main">This is the main</div>
    <div role="contentinfo">This is the footer</div>
  </body>
```
Apperantly those defined sections are very important and are said to make the web page more readable. 

### Continued development
I intend on immproving on making my web pages more accessible for people with sight disability in more ways than just implemeting sections, In addition much like last time i intend on improving my research skills in order to make much more responsive and dynamic web pages.
